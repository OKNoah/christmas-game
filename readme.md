# Christmas game

This is just a demonstration of websockets. In particular it was used to test my [example of a game server in my server framework](https://github.com/OKNoah/final/pull/3/files). Probably no reason to try use this as the API will change.

The "game" lets users control a coloured dot and move around a screen with other folks over a network. Choose a colour and begin by visiting `/?color=salmon`, or any colour you like, including hex values.
